# Week 0

*How 2 Git & text edit*

*Greetings.* This repository will be used to store projects for the first week at Holberton Coding School. This will mainly contain commits and pushes from a local repo in a virtual machine, with the files written using *EMACS* and *vi* (so that we learn how to use them and to choose the one that seems more comfortable to us).

And, a random quote: "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"

  This document was made with *EMACS*
